This project demonstrates how to open a 'child' window, pass information to it and return information back to the 'parent' window.
In particular the problem that arise from the fact that no notification is given to a 'parent' window when a 'child' window is closed. 

Both approaches to returning data from a 'child' window are valid, but I prefer to use the event based method, as it does not polute Alloy.Globals.
And in my opinion it is the most elegant way to solve the problem
